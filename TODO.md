## ICONS (Icon Shortcodes plugin)

Add "icon:" into frontmatter for document type:

- JournalEntry (book-open)
- JournalEntryPage (sticky-note)
- Actor (user)
- Item (luggage)
- Folder (folder)
- RollTable (list)

The following are less likely to be useful:

- Compendium (book-copy)
- Scene (map)
- Playlist (music)
- Cards (spade)
- ChatMessage (messages-square)
- Combat (swords)
- Macro ()
- User ()

## ROLL TABLES

Convert roll table into a MARKDOWN table:

- left column = number range
- right column = text or link

## ACTORS and ITEMS

A page showing the `JSON.stringify(json, null, 2)` (see exportToJSON)

## SCENE

Convert to whatever Obsidian has as a map plugin:

- scene background
- scene notes

## PLAYLIST

Simply store the file as a binary file

## CHAT LIST

One note per entry?
